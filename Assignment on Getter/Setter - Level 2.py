A university wants to automate their admission process. Students are admitted based on marks scored in a qualifying exam.
# A student is identified by student id, age and marks in qualifying exam. Data are valid, if:

# Age is greater than 20
# Marks is between 0 and 100 (both inclusive)
# A student qualifies for admission, if

# Age and marks are valid and
# Marks is 65 or more
# Write a python program to represent the students seeking admission in the university.

# The details of student class are given below.

# Class name: Student

# Attributes
# (private)

# student_id
# marks
# age

 

# Methods
# (public)

# __init__()

# Create and initialize all instance variables to None

 

# validate_marks()

 

# If data is valid, return true. Else, return false

 

# validate_age()

 

# check_qualification()

# Validate marks and age.

# If valid, check if marks is 65 or more.
# If so return true
# Else return false
# Else return false
 

# setter methods

# Include setter methods for all instance variables to set its values

 

# getter methods

# Include getter methods for all instance variables to get its values
